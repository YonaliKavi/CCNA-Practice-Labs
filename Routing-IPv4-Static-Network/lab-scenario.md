# Routing Lab – IPv4 Static – Network

## Objective
- Learn and practice static IPv4 routing
- Configure routers with static routes
- Ensure all devices communicate correctly

## Network Setup
- Multiple routers and PCs connected
- Assign IPv4 addresses according to design
- Configure static routing on each router

## Steps
1. Identify network topology and requirements
2. Assign IP addresses to all devices
3. Configure static routes on each router
4. Test connectivity using ping and traceroute
5. Verify routing table entries

## My Contribution
- Designed network topology and IP addressing scheme
- Configured static routes on routers
- Tested connectivity and validated network design
- Documented steps, topology diagrams, and configuration
